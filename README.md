HOLA friends.

this is my take on the double pendulum.
very rudimentary in execution but a program. inspired from the coding train's video.
part of the whole physics simulations series.

Do want to eventually shift to cpp for a much more optimised program and just work with it.
always wanted to but couldn't get around to makinf projects as such it in.
soon. kinda tangled in this whole making games with a game engine.

I do have projects in mind for cpp.



Coming back to the project at hand.
this is done in python using pygame.
was very fun to make and go thru the math tbh.
